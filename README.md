# Detection-of-DDOS-attack-using-machine-learning-
Dataset: CICDDoS2019(got it from Kaggle)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning–based DDoS attack detection system using the CICDDoS2019 dataset.
The goal is to accurately classify network traffic as Benign (0) or Attack (1) using multiple machine learning models and feature selection techniques.

The project follows a complete ML pipeline including:
