# Detection-of-DDOS-attack-using-machine-learning-
Dataset: CICDDoS2019(got it from Kaggle)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning–based DDoS attack detection system using the CICDDoS2019 dataset.
The goal is to accurately classify network traffic as Benign (0) or Attack (1) using multiple machine learning models and feature selection techniques.

The project follows a complete ML pipeline including:

Data Collection
        
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
        
Label Encoding (Binary)
        
Normalization

Feature Selection (RFE & MI)

Data Balancing (SMOTE)

Train-Test Split (80:20)

Model Training

Model Evaluation
